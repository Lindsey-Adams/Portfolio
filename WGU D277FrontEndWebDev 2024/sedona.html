      <h2>Sustainable Tourism Tips</h2>
      <h6>(Love It like a Local - Sedona, Arizona)</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Be a Good Neighbor</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Many nationally or locally known trailheads are located in neighborhoods! Please be mindful of your
            speed/noise, and watch for pedestrians.</li>
          <li>Did you know? Sedona offers free public shuttles during their busy season to the most popular trails.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Trail Etiquette and Safety</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave no trace behind! (of your presence while out in nature)</li>
          <li>"Don't bust the crust!" The soil in this area is alive, and is known as cryptobiotic soil. It is easily
            damaged just by stepping off the trail.</li>
          <li>Fire Safety is always a concern in this area, and during dry months fire of any kind is prohibited. You
            can
            always check the Forest Service website for fire restrictions before you hit the trail or pick a campsite.
          </li>
          <li>"Let's talk about poop." <em>Love it Like a Local</em> says it best with the following advice: "The best
            thing to do with your poop, your toddler’s poop, or your pet’s poop is to pack it out with you. In a pinch,
            it
            is OK to use a digging tool to bury poop at least 6-to-7 inches in the ground. Always be prepared to respond
            appropriately when nature calls. Do not leave behind a dirty diaper or other trash.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tag Responsibly</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Geotagging or posting exact location of a natural site or resource can do significant damage from the
            resulting crowd drawn to the natural beauty of the environment. However the environment in this area is
            especially fragile and unique. Please think twice before geotagging to prevent overtourism.</li>
