# **ABOUT ME** 🌅
My name is Lindsey, and I am a student studying software engineering at WGU (fall 2023-present). I am navigating a career transition into technology after 5 years of professional clinical practice as a medical speech-langauge pathologist where I specialize in adults neurorehabilitation. Before making the decision to go back to school, I have completed my MS Communication Disorders at Arizona State University.
