# **ABOUT ME**
My name is Lindsey, and I am a student studying software engineering at WGU (2023-present). I am navigating a career transition from medical speech-langauge pathology (specializing in adults with aquired brain injury) into technology. Feel free to take a look at my work. Let me know what you like (or don't like!) about my work.
