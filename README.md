# **ABOUT ME** 🌅
My name is Lindsey, and I am a student studying software engineering at WGU (fall 2023-present). I am navigating a career transition into technology after 5 years of professional clinical practice as a medical speech-langauge pathologist where I specialize in adult neurorehabilitation. Before making the decision to go back to school, I have completed my MS Communication Disorders at Arizona State University. Dive into my repository to discover my projects that reflect my growth and learning in software development. Your feedback is invaluable - Explore my work and share your insights!
