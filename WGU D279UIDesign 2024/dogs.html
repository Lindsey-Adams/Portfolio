                        are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers
                        mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a
                        companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show

                                    Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature.
                                    Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per
                                    day when they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be
                                    reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally
                                    reduced to one meal after they reach one year old.

                                    composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The <a

                                    death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!

                                    Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs
                                    healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise
                                    varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120
                                    minutes of exercise is recommended per day! <span class="fw-lighter">Can you imagine
                                        exercising two hours per

                                        to me makes me cringe!</span> And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean
                                    you are
                                    being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose
                                    from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age
                                    appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that
                                    require supervision.

                                    Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to
                                    brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur
                                    that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks
                                    and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas.

                                    Bathing is not only
                                    important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed
                                    the dog is. Rinse <strong>all</strong> of the soap out, as any residual soap can
                                    result in a rash. Be
                                    sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause
                                    allergic reactions.

                                    And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No
                                    matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If
                                    you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the
                                    forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with
                                    both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
                                    rear as you lift.
